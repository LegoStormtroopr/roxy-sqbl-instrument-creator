Roxy SQBL Instrument Creator
============================

The Roxy Instrument Creator is an XSL based transformation for converting XML questionnaire specifications written in SQBL into dynamic XForms that can be displayed using tools such as Orbeon or XSLTForms.

Roxy is the main visualisation tool in the [Canard Question Module Editor](https://github.com/LegoStormtroopr/canard), but can be used within any XML process by an XSLT1.0 for questionnaire creation.
